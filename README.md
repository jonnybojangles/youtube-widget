Youtube Widget
===
Implement a single page that interfaces with the Youtube API (iframe or JS) as well as the
Youtube feed API and renders videos about Oculus VR using only JS, HTML & CSS.

## Requirements
- Only a body tag. Make use of a templating engine
- Show one video at a time
- Navigation for different videos
- Each nav item should show a thumbnail of it's video
- Video should load dynamically, no change to the page's URL
- Cache video data
- Cross browser
- Have fun

## Like to do
- karma and Jasmine unit tests
- Grunt build server for concatenation and magnification
- Bower for dependencies
- Use font awesome for great icons
- Dependency load CSS
- 16:9 iframe wrapper so there is no blink when the player loads
- slide in and out channel list for more video player real estate
- responsive if possible at the element level rather than window.
